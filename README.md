# JavaGrokkAlgorithms 8/11

This repository contains simple realization of algorithms from Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People.
Currently I've added only 8 of 11 chapters, so if you want, you could clone this repo and open a pull request, also feel free to add issues if you find any.

#### TODO:
- 9th Chapter Dynamic Programming
- 10th Chapter KNN
- 11th Chapter Extra Algorithms
- JUnit instead of simple tests
